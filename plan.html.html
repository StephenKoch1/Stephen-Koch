<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Stephen Koch jc255464</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The overall goal for our client, Slammers Beach Volleyball, is to design a website that will increase family and youth participation in both playing volleyball and spectating. Slammers Beach Volleyball is a local business looking to expand it's current user base of approximately 100 weekly patrons by establishing an online presence. In turn our client is looking for a 50% increasing in the client base.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> Ultimately, the success of this website will be measured by several factors:
<br>a)	The amount of site traffic generated.
<br>b)	A healthy percentage of visitor who sign up.
<br>c)	Total growth of player base by 50%.
</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Ideally, the Slammers Beach Volleyball&rsquo;s main target  audience is young families, and high school students. Our client believes that  greater brand exposure would increase both under 30&rsquo;s game participation and  competition spectatorship. Additionally, Slammers&rsquo; would also like to advertise  their social facilities (aka: licensed bar), which should also attract younger  people for frequent events.</p>
